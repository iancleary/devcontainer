Images are built and pushed to DockerHub and GitHub container registery automatically on releases.

## Custom Preferences

I installed ohmyzsh, along with powerlevel10k, and the MesloLGS NF fonts.

So if you want to use this as a base, the Dockerfile would be something like:

```Dockerfile
FROM iancleary/devcontainer

RUN commands
```
